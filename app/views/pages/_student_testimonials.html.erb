          <p class="mb-0">Ife was superb! He has a certain style that just helps you understand things - i think the way in which he has the ability to both quickly explain but also show you was really refreshing - it's not always just the understanding that's a challenge but the implementation and Ife was really good at this, and it certainly helped me in the front end of our final project. I am so grateful for having Ife as our project TA, he's a real asset to Le Wagon, London.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Thank you for being a brilliant TA! You kept our eccentric team calm, cool and collected during the really tough times when we were falling apart. Really appreciate your support and positive attitude to coding. You gave us the confidence we needed to push ourselves when we didn't think we could do certain things. Also thank you for giving honest, on the spot feedback when our app didn't look good, we really needed that. And thank you so much for making frontend look easy when it wasn't for me when I first started and found it annoying. Now I think I am pretty good at it!</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Ife was one of the best TAâ€™s we had in my opinion. Anytime any of my classmates brought him up it was only in a very positive manner. He was very proactive in helping students and checking in. He was very knowledgeable and every single problem I went to him with he was able to solve very quickly. Even though it was not expected of him in any way he was happy to help even after it had turned to six pm on project week which was very much appreciated. Extremely encouraging and reassuring when things got a bit hard.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">The master of front-end! The number of tickets with him increased each day towards the end. He is a super lovely, kind, patient, and engaging person, and was super helpful when it came to solving front end issues!! You could clearly see that he knows very well what he was talking about and he was also very well in explaining a problem and the matching solution! I really liked working with him because he also sticked to the problem until it was solved.</p>

I really enjoyed working with Ife and can't recommend him enough!</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Ife is not only an outstanding teacher but he acted as a sort of mentor during the last few weeks of my coding experience. He was happy to help us navigate tricky team conversations and was very invested in our app. He got excited about what we wanted to achieve and very much supported us. He gave critical yet constructive feedback and but is always a very calming persona to have around. Ife helps students to get to an endpoint by coaching them rather than telling them the answer so that you feel like you have achieved something. I think my Le Wagon experience would have been very different without Ife and I am so grateful for the support and encouragement he gave our team.</p>
