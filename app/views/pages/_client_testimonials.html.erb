          <p>Ife was the first person I hired at Hoxton Digital and he is the first person I would hire if I started a new business tomorrow. He is hard working, utterly dependable and lifts the spirits of everyone he works with! Ife is the first person I turn to for a second opinion on frontend matters, his ability to cast a critical eye over a design and suggest meaningful ways to improve the UI & UX of the application has been a priceless tool for me over the years. He constantly strives to do his job in the best way possible as well as to help others to do theirs. I hope I get the opportunity to work with him in the future and I would absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a frontend developer.</p>
